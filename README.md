# ðŸ“–Introduction
Anaemia is a persistent public health concern with serious consequences for women and children. It weakens immunity, reduces productivity, increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality, and slows socioeconomic development. In low-resource settings, anaemia is often caused by poor nutrition, malaria, early pregnancies, and inequities in access to healthcare and education.
This analysis was carried out using anaemia-related health data, focusing on key determinants such as age at first birth, education level, mosquito-net usage, haemoglobin levels, residence, and wealth index. The results aim to guide health-sector decision-making and program design.


## Dataset Overview
![](Anaemie_Orignal_dataset.jpg)

This project analyzes anaemia-related health data with a focus on demographic and socioeconomic determinants. The dataset was visualized through a dashboard and explored across multiple indicators, including:

- Age at first birth

- Education level

- Mosquito-net usage

- Haemoglobin levels by age group

- Residence (rural vs urban)

- Wealth index


The aim is to generate health-sector insights that can inform decision-making, resource allocation, and intervention strategies.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

-	Assess the distribution of anaemia across demographic and socioeconomic groups.


-	Identify factors associated with higher anaemia burden (education, wealth, rural residence, early pregnancies).


-	Highlight high-risk groups most affected by anaemia.


-	Provide actionable recommendations for health-sector programs.

## ðŸ”¬ Data Analysis Stages

![](Anaemia_clean_dataset.jpg)
-	Data Collection â€“ extracted anaemia-related survey indicators and aggregated counts.


-	Data Cleaning â€“ ensured completeness, categorized haemoglobin levels, standardized socioeconomic groupings.


-	Exploration â€“ generated descriptive summaries and cross-tabulations.


-	Visualization â€“ created a dashboard with charts showing disparities across groups.


-	Interpretation â€“ identified vulnerable populations and health-sector implications.


# ðŸ“Š Key Findings
![](https://github.com/christopherstanleyobinna-rgb/-Anaemia-Health-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Anaemia%20dashboard.jpg)

- Early pregnancies (<24 years) strongly associated with anaemia.

- No education â†’ highest anaemia cases; higher education â†’ lowest.

- Rural women (1,694 cases) had >2Ã— anaemia compared to urban women (745 cases).

- Poorest households had the greatest burden; richest households had minimal cases.

- Anaemia concentrated among reproductive-age women (20â€“34 years).

- Mosquito-net users had higher recorded cases, reflecting distribution in malaria-prone areas.


# ðŸ©º Health-Sector Recommendations

- Adolescents & young mothers â†’ expand reproductive health education, family planning, and iron supplementation.

- Rural populations â†’ strengthen outreach services, supply diagnostic kits and supplements.

- Poverty & nutrition â†’ implement food fortification, provide nutrition support programs.

- Malaria integration â†’ couple mosquito-net distribution with anaemia screening and preventive treatment.

- Education & awareness â†’ promote nutrition literacy and dietary practices that improve iron intake.


# ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

Anaemia disproportionately affects young mothers, women with no education, rural residents, and the poorest households. Tackling this challenge requires integrated health-sector strategies that combine nutrition interventions, reproductive health services, malaria control, and socioeconomic support.
